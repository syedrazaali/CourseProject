5	2/ As long as BTC and BCH are on same PoW algo, (at least) one is fundamentally insecure.  We can have ceasefires amidst a longer “war”, but we’re in a state of disequilibrium.  I expect the disequilibrium to persist for a while and cause a lot of drama before ultimate PoW fork.	2017-11-14	-0.16999999999999998

7	For the record: I totally agree with the assessment of @ryanxcharles. After BCH appeared on my radar I evaluated the scaling roadmaps of #BTC and #BCH from a tech and economic perspective.
