346	Of course, we're baking in assumptions here holding BTC's valuation constant, but as a relative pair trade comparing to on chain transaction volumes, the case could easily be made LTC is undervalued given historical correlations.	2017-11-20	0.10833333333333334
347	This valuation and price would be consistent with LTC's on chain transaction volume relative to BTC, again, running at about 10% as of a few days ago. BTC market cap running around $129bn, LTC at 3% (top of range), $240, would value at $12.9bn	2017-11-20	0.1375
