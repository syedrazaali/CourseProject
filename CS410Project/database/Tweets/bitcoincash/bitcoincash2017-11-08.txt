4	Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. Segwitcoin was perverted from the inside out to become Blockstream's sidechain fee business. Turning on the miners was the dumbest thing they could do. Miners are intrinsic to Bitcoin. Miners who are now very upset 2x didn't happen. BCH is their solution.	2017-11-08	0.2

13	Looking at the first few days of $BCH #bitcoin_cash fork. It jumped from 0.066 BTC to 0.243 btc in only two days. That's 4 times the price. I would expect it to get back up there again pretty soon too. https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_bch …	2017-11-08	0.06
14	Bitcoin Cash is a parasite coin that aims to undermine and suck value out of Bitcoin. It’s not like other altcoins. We should be prepared for a BCH pump during fork which could have unpredictable effects on miner incentives and harm the true Bitcoin block chain.	2017-11-08	0.019444444444444448

25	FWIW I'm a huge #BitcoinCash advocate and currently hold 100% $BCH. But I think that after today's news we as a community should seriously consider that Bitcoin Cash won't be taking the #Bitcoin brand and $BTC ticker regardless of if it gets the most hash power or not.	2017-11-08	0.1416666666666667

30	@ThomasEWoods just trying to help, but Roger was misleading you. BCH (Bitcoin cash) ($600) is not BTC (Bitcoin)($7500).  Roger & a large Chinese miner forked Bitcoin and attempted to take the name. It was not an upgrade. The Bitcoin you have is the original chain. Love your work.	2017-11-08	0.2723214285714286
