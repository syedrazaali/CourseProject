5	2/ As long as BTC and BCH are on same PoW algo, (at least) one is fundamentally insecure.  We can have ceasefires amidst a longer “war”, but we’re in a state of disequilibrium.  I expect the disequilibrium to persist for a while and cause a lot of drama before ultimate PoW fork.	2017-11-14	-0.16999999999999998

7	For the record: I totally agree with the assessment of @ryanxcharles. After BCH appeared on my radar I evaluated the scaling roadmaps of #BTC and #BCH from a tech and economic perspective. In conclusion I dumped all my BTC and altcoins and went all-in with BCH about a month ago. https://twitter.com/ryanxcharles/status/930506288747790336 …	2017-11-14	0.1
8	1/ The idea that BTC and BCH can be friendly differentiated currencies is nonsense.  PoW mining is one of the key underpinnings of “trustless digital scarcity”, and it breaks if miners can attack a chain and retain economic value of their hardware.	2017-11-14	0.14375
9	Thought experiment posed to me by @RafaelCosman that I’ve struggled with.  Is a more deflationary cryotocurrency more valuable/desirable?  Would BTC be more attractive with 1% deflation instead of the 4%->0% inflation it has?  (Ignore PoW bootstrapping considerations.)	2017-11-14	0.575
