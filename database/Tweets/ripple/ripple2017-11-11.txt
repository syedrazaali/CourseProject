567	I am calling $10k by end of year now the fork drama is resolved. Would have been a bit better to see B2X fail technically and in the market. But seeing BCH do the same is ok too. Take the dividend, buy Bitcoin, buy any dips, HODL. I don't really think of smaller than 20% a dip.	2017-11-11	0.09999999999999999
