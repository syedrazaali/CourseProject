4	"Like I said, relay fees are controlled by a constant. Since LTC value went up more than 10x, so has relay fees. We will lower them.

Why not support both Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash? Litecoin will get a lot of improvements BCH won't due to SegWit. And we have Coinbase buys."	2017-11-09	0.125
5	Dude I appreciate all your work but don't piss on people who also put a lot of effort and work in to making bitcoin cash a success. My preference is orange but I have made and used green stuff for bch too. You're a member of the same slacks as a lot of these guys, show respect.	2017-11-09	0.033333333333333326
6	I think everyone likes bitcoin cash here. We don't have to fix the color now. Let's put small difference aside and unit to make BCH win!	2017-11-09	0.375
7	"Everyone that hates on Bitcoin Cash $BCH $BCC should read this. Educate yourself. Satoshi was fine with a block size increase, which @jgarzik proposed. Elimination of Sewgwit2X only proves that BitcoinCash is the real Bitcoin! @rogerkver @JihanWu

8	I mean, it could also maybe have something to do with BCH only having 1 exahash versus 11 exahash... issues with initial EDA and not having easy access ti FIAT onramps into the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. Although I appreciate your effort, correlation/=causation.	2017-11-09	0.030208333333333337
9	SegwitCoin is better than gold. Might make me rich. But Bitcoin (cash) has a million use cases and is just better because its cheap. I hold both as do most of us but BCH is the coin worth fighting for in my eyes. +Bitcoin is totally taken over by Blockstream.	2017-11-09	0.3678571428571428

17	I’m sure they will.  After all this- I’m hoping @ErikVoorhees may @ShapeShift_io his position on Bitcoin Cash, and stand with @rogerkver , myself and others in support of  #BCH	2017-11-09	0.5
18	Cryptocurrency exchanges, this might be a good time to start doing more BCH pairs with alt-coins, instead of using BTC. It's a lot easier to move Bitcoin Cash between exchanges than the legacy Bitcoin Segwit.	2017-11-09	0.6

20	"I don't think color is the right way to distinguish.  

1: you have the name Bitcoin Cash that distinguishes 

2: you have the ticker BCH that distinguishes 

3: the logo is distinct as it has squares around the coin

Going green would make a drastic cut to Bitcoin's origin."	2017-11-09	0.12857142857142853

27	@rogerkver Why not ask Coinbase to support direct buying of Bitcoin cash using fiat? That's probably the only thing restraining bitcoin cash. Would also be great if exchanges listed pairs against BCH but that won't happen soon I guess.	2017-11-09	0.3

30	bitcoin cash was made with an inflation bug to make money for miners and to still use asicboost. if bch was actually used, the mem pool would quickly fill. They would have to keep expanding, centralizing the system. On chain transactions will never be possible for small payments.	2017-11-09	0.02083333333333333
31	BCH paper wallets and not sure how to move your coins? use electroncash. it can read your paper key. Then for an easy all platform interface, use the http://bitcoin.com  app. Sweep electron cash to the bitcoin cash wallet address. But first @rogerkver	2017-11-09	0.10833333333333334
